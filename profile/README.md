# Welcome to IOT Link Chain

### What is IoT?

The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects incorporated with sensors, software and other technologies with the aim of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from common household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. With more than 7 billion IoT devices connected today, experts expect that number to grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025.

### What technologies made IoT possible?

Although the idea of IoT has been around for a long time, a collection of recent advances in several different technologies has made it practical.

Access to low-cost, low-power sensor technology. Affordable and reliable sensors are enabling IoT technology for more manufacturers.
Connectivity. A series of networking protocols for the Internet have made it easy to connect sensors to the cloud and other things for efficient data transfer.
Cloud computing platforms. The increased availability of cloud platforms allows businesses and consumers to access the infrastructure they need to scale without having to manage it all.
Machine learning and advanced analysis. With advances in machine learning and advanced analytics, as well as access to large and varied amounts of data stored in the cloud, companies can gain insights more quickly and easily. The emergence of these allied technologies continues to push the boundaries of IoT and the data produced by IoT also powers these technologies.
Conversational artificial intelligence (AI). Advances in neural networks have brought natural-language processing (NLP) to IoT devices (such as personal digital assistants Alexa, Cortana, and Siri) and made them attractive, affordable, and viable for home use.

With all this in mind, the IOT LINK CHAIN (ILC) project was started. We are a network that aims to improve the performance of bitcoin using its base code and implementing new features within it, including:

- POS3.0 - for an acceleration in the spacing in each block and bringing income to the holders of our coins.

- UTXO - Bitcoin payment system. UTXO is an acronym for Unspent Transaction Outputs. Unlike Ethereum's 'Account Balance Model', there is no account and balance, it verifies currency by examining the validity of a transaction through 'Unused Output'.

- ILC tokens (There cannot be tokens with the same name as the main network, since we are the main network and therefore a token).

- Minimum Fees - 0.0001ILC transaction depending on network congestion, fees will always be sent to the node that generated the block along with the PoS reward.
